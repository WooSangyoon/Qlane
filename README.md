# Qlane

This project explores hybrid classical–quantum modeling for structured lane detection.
Instead of end-to-end perception, the focus is on structured inference—predicting lane existence and geometry using anchor-based representations, with a quantum model integrated as a refinement component.

The goal is to better understand where and how quantum machine learning (QML) behaves in structured prediction tasks under realistic constraints.
